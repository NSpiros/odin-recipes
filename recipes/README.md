# odin-recipes

This is my first project!

Components used in this project are :Lists,Paragraphs,Images,Links to different elements and in my opinion most valuable Git usage.Although i didn;t commit so often it end up valuable lesson on when to commit and how.

Programming Language used was plain HTML.No CSS added.

Update 04/03/2023 : Added CSS after instructed.Familiarize myself with how CSS works specially when it comes to text.(decoration,alignment,font,etc.)
